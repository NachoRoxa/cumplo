This is a project that let you track the current currency between CLP and USD and show a line chart depending on the days you pick.

## Used Libraries

### Recharts

http://recharts.org/en-US

I used it to draw the chart is rather simple and easy on the eye to look and work with.

### React-Day-Picker

https://react-day-picker.js.org

I wanted to use this one because the documentation is very thorough, it updates rather frecuently and was the only one with an example of how to select multiple days or a range of days.

### React DatePicker

https://reactdatepicker.com

I try this one during the first day of development but was a little to difficult to work with and it doesn't have much docs, and the examples assume that you know how to work with hooks, something that I'm currently just started to learn.

## API

### CMF Bancos

http://api.sbif.cl/index.html

This is the API that was used to track the currency.
